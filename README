This is a small project that intends to implement basic versions of some core data structures. Basically the point is to cover common interview questions.

Here's what I intend to cover:

* Linked lists
 - Double vs single
 - Circular vs linear
 - basic operations: insert into, delete from, reverse
* Binary trees
 - basic operations: inserting, deleting
 - traversing: inorder, preorder, postorder (recursive and stack-based)
 - balancing
* Hash tables
* Sorting algorithms
 - insertion sort
 - quicksort
